# Day-14-of-Learning-Java
In the Day 14 I made a "Student Management System" in which Insertion, Deletion, Updation and Fetching can be possible.
 
In this:- 

Firstly, I made the Connection using Driver class. 

Then I prepare Statements.

Do the CRUD (Create,Read,Update & Delete) operation. Then Execute the code.
